# Graph3D

A package building upon iOS Framework `GameplayKit`'s class  `GKGraph` to create a routing graph specific for navigating 3D positions.

I have used this previously for Augmented Reality projects, and thought it could be useful for other developers.

Check out [the tests](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/Swift-Graph3D/blob/master/Tests/Graph3DTests/Graph3DTests.swift) for examples how to use this package.

Please feel free to test it out and contribute to this repository if there are some improvements you'd like to see.
