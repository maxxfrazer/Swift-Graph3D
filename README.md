# Graph3D

A package building upon iOS Framework `GameplayKit`'s class  `GKGraph` to create a routing graph specific for navigating 3D positions.

I have used this previously for Augmented Reality projects, and thought it could be useful for other developers. Will be updating this README with documentation and add more tests to this repository in the coming weeks.

Please feel free to test it out and contribute to this repository if there are some improvements you'd like to see.
